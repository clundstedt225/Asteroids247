# :joystick: MonoGame Asteroids
This was a final personal capstone project for AGGP 247 - Math & Physics for Game Programmers at NHTI

For our final project, we were allowed to choose a simple game to recreate. This allowed us to apply
what we had learned in the course on our own. For my project I chose to recreate the classic Atari 
game Asteroids.

## 	:world_map: Project Navigation
- All source code [can be found here](https://github.com/clundstedt225/Asteroids247/tree/master/asteroids/DrawingExample/Core).

### BaseGameObject.cs
- The [BaseGameObject](https://github.com/clundstedt225/Asteroids247/blob/master/asteroids/DrawingExample/Core/BaseGameObject.cs) class was created for all GameObject classes to inherit from and extend.

### Asteroids.cs 
(Encapsulation was used here to keep collision detection and GameObject destruction contained)
- The [AsteroidTools](https://github.com/clundstedt225/Asteroids247/blob/master/asteroids/DrawingExample/Core/Asteroids.cs) namespace is where GameObject classes such as the player are defined.


## 	:hammer_and_wrench: Tools & Languages Used
