# MonoGame Asteroids
This was a final personal capstone project for AGGP 247 (Math & Physics for Game Programmers)

For our final project, we were allowed to choose a simple game to recreate. This allowed us to apply
what we had learned in the course on our own. For my project I chose to recreate the classic Atari 
game Asteroids.

## Project Tools & Languages
- MonoGame Framework: https://www.monogame.net/
- Microsoft Visual Studio IDE
- Programmed in C#

## Project Navigation
- Most of the code written [can be found here](https://github.com/clundstedt225/Asteroids247/tree/master/asteroids/DrawingExample/Core).


## Things I would change if I had more time
- Add sprites for asteroids
- Add colors to sprites
