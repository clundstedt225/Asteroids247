# MonoGame Asteroids
This was a final personal capstone project for AGGP 247 (Math & Physics for Game Programmers)

For our final project, we were allowed to choose a simple game to recreate. This allowed us to apply
what we had learned in the course, and I chose to recreate the classic Atari game Asteroids.

## Project Tools & Languages
- MonoGame Framework: https://www.monogame.net/
- Microsoft Visual Studio IDE
- Programmed in C#

## Project Navigation
- Most code written for project can be found in the (Asteroids247 -> asteroids -> DrawingExample -> Core) folder.


## Things I would change if I had more time
- Add sprites for asteroids
- Add colors to sprites
